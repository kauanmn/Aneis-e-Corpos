# Solutions

<br>

## Exercise 1

$f(x) + g(x) = 2x^2 + 5$

$f(x)g(x) = 6x^2 + 4x + 6$

---

<br>

## Exercise 2

$f(x) + g(x) = 0$

$f(x)g(x) = x^2 + 1$

---

<br>

## Exercise 3

$f(x) + g(x) = 5x^2 + 5x + 1$

$f(x)g(x) = x^3 + 5x$

---

<br>

## Exercise 4

$f(x) + g(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 1$

$f(x)g(x) = x^7 + 2x^6 + 4x^5 + x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 3$

---

<br>

## Exercise 5

Polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$ with degree $\le 3$ have the following form:

$a_{3}x^3 + a_{2}x^2 + a_{1}x + a_{0}$

Each coefficient $a_i$ has 2 possibilities: 0, 1. So, we have $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 16$ possible polynomials.

---

<br>

## Exercise 6

Polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$ with degree $\le 2$ have the following form:

$a_{2}x^2 + a_{1}x + a_{0}$

Each coefficient $a_i$ has 5 possibilities: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So, we have $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 125$ possible polynomials.
