# Solutions

<br>

## Exercise 1

$f(x) + g(x) = 2x^2 + 5$

$f(x)g(x) = 6x^2 + 4x + 6$

---

<br>

## Exercise 2

$f(x) + g(x) = 0$

$f(x)g(x) = x^2 + 1$

---

<br>

## Exercise 3

$f(x) + g(x) = 5x^2 + 5x + 1$

$f(x)g(x) = x^3 + 5x$

---

<br>

## Exercise 4

$f(x) + g(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 1$

$f(x)g(x) = x^7 + 2x^6 + 4x^5 + x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 3$
