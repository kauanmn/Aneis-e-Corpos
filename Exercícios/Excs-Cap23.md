# Solutions

## Exercise 1

$f(x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x)$

- $f(x) = x^6 + 3x^5 + 4x^2 - 3x + 2$
- $g(x) = x^2 + 2x - 3$
- $q(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x - 2$
- $r(x) = 4x + 3$

## Exercise 9

In $\mathbb{Z}_5, x^4 + 4 = x^4 - 1 = x^4 - 1^4 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1)$.

Again, we can do the same trick with $1 = -4$ in $\mathbb{Z}_5$:

$(x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 - 2^2)(x^2 - 1^2) = (x + 2)(x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)$

Just check which polynomial don't have roots:

Considering $\mathbb{Z}_3$:

| $f(x)$          | Has zero/reducible |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| $x^2$           | YES                |
| $x^2 + 1$       | NO                 |
| $x^2 + 2$       | YES                |
| $x^2 + x$       | YES                |
| $x^2 + x + 1$   | YES                |
| $x^2 + x + 2$   | NO                 |
| $x^2 + 2x$      | YES                |
| $x^2 + 2x + 1$  | YES                |
| $x^2 + 2x + 2$  | NO                 |
| $2x^2$          | YES                |
| $2x^2 + 1$      | YES                |
| $2x^2 + 2$      | NO                 |
| $2x^2 + x$      | YES                |
| $2x^2 + x + 1$  | NO                 |
| $2x^2 + x + 2$  | YES                |
| $2x^2 + 2x$     | YES                |
| $2x^2 + 2x + 1$ | NO                 |
| $2x^2 + 2x + 2$ | YES                |

Every polynomial without zeroes are irreducible.
