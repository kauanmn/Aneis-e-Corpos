### Exercise 1

Find all prime ideals and all maximal ideals of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary><br>

Because a finite integral domain is a field, the prime and the maximal ideals are the same.

The ideals $\\{ 0,2,4 \\}$ and $\\{ 0,3 \\}$ are both prime and maximal because the factor rings are isomorphic to the fields $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ respectively.

### Exercise 2

Find all prime ideals and all maximal ideals of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary><br>

Because a finite integral domain is a field, the prime and the maximal ideals are the same.

The ideals $\\{ 0,2,4,6,8,10 \\}$ and $\\{ 0,3,6,9 \\}$ are both prime and maximal because the factor rings are isomorphic to the fields $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ respectively.
